# This test is meant to cover whether the set of scripts that get loaded by
# default in bare mode matches a baseline of known defaults.  The baseline
# should only need updating if something new is @load'd from init-bare.zeek
# (or from an @load'd descendent of it), or when a new builtin plugin is
# added to Zeek.
#
# As the output has absolute paths in it, we need to remove the common
# prefix to make the test work everywhere. That's what the sed magic
# below does. Don't ask. :-)

# @TEST-REQUIRES: $SCRIPTS/have-spicy  # This test logs loaded scripts, so disable it if Spicy and it associated plugin is unavailable.
