# This test is meant to cover whether the set of scripts that get loaded by
# default matches a baseline of known defaults.  When new scripts are
# added to the scripts/base/ directory, the baseline will usually just need
# to be updated.
#
# As the output has absolute paths in it, we need to remove the common
# prefix to make the test work everywhere. That's what the sed magic
# below does. Don't ask. :-)
